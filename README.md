# molmicro_genomics
Protocols for the Molecular Microbiology genomics module at the Department of Biology, Aarhus University. This is a masters-level course.

This course covers sequencing and analysis of a bacterial genome using the Oxford Nanopore MinION. Not all lab-based steps are carried out by students (and thus aren't posted here), but the bioinformatics protocols are a pretty complete guide to assembling, annotating, and analysing a genome.

These protocols are far from perfect - there's a lot I'd like to improve about them, but I figured they might be useful to someone who's learning all this for the first time just as the students in the class do.
